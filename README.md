# Crop Recommendation Model (Crop Recommendation - Extra Trees Classifier)
Filename: Crop Recommendation Details - P2 Extra Trees Classifier - Notebook.ipynb
## Description:
This project is a Machine Learning-based crop recommendation system. It predicts the best crop for cultivation based on soil and climate conditions.

## Features
1. Uses the Extra Trees Classifier for prediction.
2. Analyzes parameters like Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium (NPK levels), temperature, humidity, and rainfall.
3. Outputs the best crop recommendation for a given input.

## Project Structure
1. Dataset: Contains agricultural parameters and crop labels.
2. Preprocessing: Cleans and normalizes data.
3. Model Training: Uses the Extra Trees Classifier algorithm.
4. Evaluation: Measures accuracy and performance.

## How to Use
1. Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Ensure necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, sklearn) are installed.
3. Run all cells to train the model and make predictions.

## Future Enhancements
1. Improve accuracy with other ML models like XGBoost.
2. Deploy as a web app for real-time predictions.
3. Add region-based customization for better recommendations.
